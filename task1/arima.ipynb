    "Depending on the type of our time series, there are 2 to 7 parameters that we will need to identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stationary time series:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A staionary time series is a time series whose value(and covariance) does not depend on time at which the series is observed rather just the lag ***'k'*** wrt to some other point in the series, i.e one that has a constant mean and variance (and thus by default cannot have a non zero trend). An example of a perfectly stationary time series is a sine wave. But as time series are rarely perfectly stationary, we will set a threshold(p-value of 0.05 in adfuller) and use a test (Augmented Dicky-Fuller or adfuller) to identify if the time series is stationary or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast of a stationary time series can be found using an ARMA model. It consists of two parts Autoreggressive(AR) and Moving Average(MA). Moving average is a technique that forecasts the future value of a time series data using the average (or of needed weighted average) of the past *n* values. The AR part is a regression on the time series itself measures/observed at different points with respect to a specified lag *k*. For example if we were use a AR model with lag 1 or AR(1), the model's equation would be given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Y(t+1) = μ  + βY(t) + ε(t+1)***\n",
    "\n",
    "where μ is the mean of the time series, β is the coefficient of the previous value of the time series, and ε(t+1) is the extra residual term\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we need to identify only 2 parameters/orders: **p** and **q**, the lags for the AR and MA processes respectively. The final model will be a ARMA(p,q) or ARIMA(p,0,q)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non stationary and non seasonal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If our time series does not satisfy the conditions for the stationary time series, we will use the method of differencing to convert our time series to a stationary time series. This is what the extra ***'I'*** in ARIMA stands for: Integration, i.e, order of differencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the 3 parameters/orders we will need to identify are: **p**, **q** (same as that from ARMA) and **d**, the order of differencing. The final model will be ARIMA(p,d,q).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonal time series:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If our time series has an additional seasonality component, we will need to use SARIMA/SARIMAX model to forecast (Seasonal ARIMA) for the forecast, as seasonality doesnt work well with the standard ARIMA model. For this, in addition to the 3 parameters we found in ARIMA, we will need to identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***P*** and ***Q***: the lags of the **seasonal component** of the time series\n",
    "2. ***D***: the order of differencing for the seasonal component\n",
    "3. ***s or m***: the number of seasonal periods in the time series. (i.e, if m is 12, each period will be 1/4 of a year, so quarterly. If 12, then monthly etc.)\n"
